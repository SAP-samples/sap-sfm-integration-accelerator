# SAP SFM Integration Accelerator - Installation Guide

## Fresh Installation of SFM Integration Package V2

If you do **not** have an existing version of the SFM Integration Accelerator installed **and** you do **not** have any version of the RDP Integration Accelerator installed in your system, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Install Technical Objects**
1. Install **SFM ABAP Technical Objects**: 
   - **TR 901356.BP7** (This transport request includes all customizing objects).
2. **Note:**
   - If you are on a lower SAP SP level, you may encounter errors related to the `/UI2/CL_JSON` standard class.
   - You have **two options** to resolve this:
     1. Install SAP Note **2526405 - /UI2/CL_JSON Corrections** via [SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/notes/2526405) to apply the necessary corrections.
     2. If installing the SAP Note is not possible, you may **ignore** the errors in this transport request (TR) and proceed with the remaining TRs. In this case, the TRs in Step 2 become **mandatory**.

### **Step 2: Apply Fixes (ONLY for NW version 7.4 SP15 or lower)**
- Install the following transport requests:
  - **Fixes -> TR 901375.BP7**
     *(Replaces older TRs 910061.EC6 and 900101.PCF)*
  

## Upgrading from SFM Integration Accelerator V1 to V2
